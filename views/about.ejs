      Hello! The name's Jasper Jan Tan. You may call me Jazz if you want. 
      I am a Software Engineer who specializes in Security. I can detect and troubleshoot
      exploits on your software to make sure it is safe from hackers. <br>
      <br>
      I have a passion for technology. Some of my hobbies are tinkering with 
      with microcontrollers, audio devices such as IEM, and customizing 
      computer peripherals such as mouse and keyboards.
